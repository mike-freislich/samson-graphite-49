samson-graphite-49
==================

Support for Samson Graphite 49 keyboard controller in Bitwig Studio.

I've created a simple controller script for the Samson Graphite 49. The script is written for use with the Factory Preset "P1 - Graphite" on the controller. It has two modes:

mode 1 - selected by Bank 1 on the controller - Primary Instrument Mode

* Sliders S1-S8 control the 8 macro knobs of the Instrument for the selected track
* Slider S9 controls the mixer volume for the currently selected track
* Knobs E1-E8 control the first 8 send volumes for the selected track
* Transport Play, Stop and Rec control the same in Bitwig
* Transport << and >> select previous and next track respectively
* Buttons F1-F8 Solo tracks 1 through 8 respectively
* Buttons F9-F16 Mute tracks 1 through 8 respectively
* Drum Pads P1 - P8 play notes 36 -  43 respectively


mode 2 - selected by Bank 2 on the controller - Mixer Mode

* Sliders S1-S8 control the 8 macro knobs of the Instrument for the selected track
* Slider S9 controls the mixer volume for the currently selected track
* Knobs E1-E8 control the first 8 send volumes for the selected track
* Transport Play, Stop and Rec control the same in Bitwig
* Transport << and >> select previous and next track respectively
* Buttons F1-F8 Solo tracks 1 through 8 respectively
* Buttons F9-F16 Mute tracks 1 through 8 respectively
* Drum Pads P1 - P8 play notes 36 -  43 respectively
